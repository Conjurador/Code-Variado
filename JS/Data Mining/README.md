# General

Codes for extract data for pages, some case you will need use JQUERY for extraction

# How to use
Add line below in your HTML page: 
```
	<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js"></script>
```

Or use this version and put on together your HTML code:
```
	<script src="jquery-3.3.1.min.js"></script>
```
And add your javascript code in console of browser or add line below in ```<head>``` tag:
```
	<script src="<name your script in here>"></script>
```


Many cases you will need see console or your code can rewrite a file for download (locally). (I'll put a issue for this)
