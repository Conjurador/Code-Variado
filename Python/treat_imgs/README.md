# Simple code for data augmentation of images

## Requirements
* Python3
* Numpy (library of Python)
* OpenCV (library of Python, specifically is cv2)

## Usage
This code is too simple, run simple_treat.py in your directory with images (PNG or JPG) and then it will make new directory with versions changing Brightness, Saturation and Contrast.

Setting values in simple_treat.py in:
	brightness = 250
	contrast = 100
	saturation = 0
